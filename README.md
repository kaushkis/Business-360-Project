About AtliQ Hardware
AtliQ Hardware manufactures and sells hardware like PC, Mouse, Printers, etc., to multiple companies across the world. AtliQ’s customers are companies like Croma, Amazon, Neptune, Staples, Walmart, etc. These customers are of two types – Physical Stores and E-commerce platforms.

Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware is struggling to do good business in Latin America. So far, all the decisions that AtliQ took have been based on some surveys and intuitions. The company was doing some analysis using MS Excel files because of limited data. Now that the company has grown and has plenty of data to analyze, the management has decided to hire a Data Analyst. The management wants Data Analysts to utilize this data to make accurate and informed decisions.

Management’s Dashboard Requirements
The management wants to see these reports in the Power BI Dashboard:

Finance View – This will show the profit and loss statements across different products, markets, customers, etc.
Sales View – To display the top-performing and bottom-performing customers with different key metrics.
Marketing View – Similar data as of Sales View but product-based instead of customers.
Supply Chain – Reliability and accuracy to better understand the supply chain performance.
Executive View – This includes the integrated view of key insights for executives.

##Dashboard Created (Dynamic Dashboard)
This Power BI project is not just a project but a course created with real-life business scenarios. Like recorded business meetings with stakeholders. Feedback after every design is created and shared with the stakeholders, changing and adding features to the report that saves time and provides all the required key metrics in the consolidated report, etc.
